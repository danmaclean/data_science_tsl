# Why Care About Data Science {.unnumbered}


At first thought, you may imagine that data science is not going to be of much interest to you, your desire and interest is in biology, not computers and mathematics. That may be true but data science is actually going to be one of the main technical themes throughout your entire scientific career and it will help you truly master your science and to become an informed and healthily sceptical interpreter of scientific results. Adding data science as your super power will be of benefit in lots of ways. Learning data science now isn't a tax on your time so that you can get through this M.Sc, it's a valuable investment in your skill set that will help to give you an advantage that will pay definite dividends later. Getting on with data science is like getting on with Jedi training for biologists

## All experimental science is data science sooner or later

"Data Science" is a new-ish term that describes an interdisciplinary approach to the practical application of statistics and computer science concepts and tools. The term data scientist is most often applied to people who analyse large amounts of high throughput data full time and have a research or industrial interest in that but the techniques of data science are useful to all researchers, data science is useful to biologists. There is no such thing as a purely lab- or field-based biologist, once our data are collected we must use it in a computer to perform analyses, draw conclusions and draw figures. All modern scientists are at some point a data scientist, irrespective of field and training. Knowledge of data science techniques will therefore underpin everything you do as a scientist at the most fundamental level, from experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of results. A scientist that lacks data science skills will find it very difficult to progress beyond the most basic levels of expertise in experimental analysis.

## Biology is getting bigger

All biological disciplines including genomics and genetics, microscopy, biochemistry and proteomics generate volumes of data that are too great to handle by a scientist armed only with a clipboard and spreadsheet, no matter how hard working they are. At the heart of data science are the techniques for dealing with the biggest data sets yet generated and learning just a little about them will stand you in good stead across your entire career.  

## Data science methods are 21st Century realisations of the scientific method

Reproducibility and clear description of process is the keystone of the scientific method, using point and click tools to carry out analyses often do nothing to help you reach this goal but many data science techniques are built with these qualities as a primary design principle and can help to reduce your workload by helping you to do things reproducibly over and again with ease. They can help you share and report on your research and data in a way that is transparent and clear to the reader. They can also help you make the data and analysis you have generated shareable and findable by others.
