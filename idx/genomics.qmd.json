{"title":"Introduction to Genomics","markdown":{"headingText":"Introduction to Genomics","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nGenomics is a big field with wide use within biology. On the Global Plant Health M.Sc you are going to learn about a lot of applications of genomics technologies and data science skills underpin _all_ of those applications and analysis. So in this first, foundational topic we will look at how to run a basic genomics SNP calling pipeline on the Linux command line. This will include developing the basic skills to use the computer from the command line.\n\n\n\n## The materials\n\nAs a source for this we will follow the excellent Data Carpentry Genomics Curriculum [https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop). We will do the following two lessons\n\n\n  1. [Shell Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/)\n  2. [Data Wrangling and Processing for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/)\n  \nWe will also use these materials  \n  \n  3. [Genome, Transcriptome and Structural Databases](https://danmaclean.github.io/databases/)\n\n## For you to do\n\nParts 1 (Shell Genomics) and 2 (Data Wrangling) will be full contact time instructor led bootcamp courses. You should try reading the materials _before_ the course dates - it will help a great deal.\n\nPart 3 is mostly an interactive tutorial, please work through that _before_ the scheduled discussion session in which we will go over as a group any questions and problems you may have had working through the materials.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"genomics.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":6.5,"fig-height":4.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"genomics.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
