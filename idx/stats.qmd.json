{"title":"Understanding Statistics With Linear Models","markdown":{"headingText":"Understanding Statistics With Linear Models","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nIn this topic we will take a look at common statistical methods. Rather than launch into a long list of tests and conditions for use  we will take advantage of the fact that they are all special cases of a simple tool called a linear model. We will learn about linear models and how to use them to carry out statistical inference. By the end of this topic you will have a clear understanding of how and why to use a linear model in R to carry out most tests and comparisons.\n\n```{r, fig.cap=\"Artwork by [\\\\@AllisonHorst](https://github.com/allisonhorst)\", echo=FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"ex_4.png\")\n```\n\n\n## The materials \n\nFor this topic we will use this course\n\n  1.
