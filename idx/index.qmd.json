Learning a practical skill requires practice! So this course is not a lecture course, it is a 'flipped' classroom course with a very strong practical component. In a flipped classroom the onus is on the student to lead their work and practice with the provided materials prior to contact and discussion time with the wider learning group and group mentors. To get the most out of this course you must read the relevant online material before you come to the contact sessions. Contact time will then be an opportunity to discuss the materials and any problems arising with the group and the teacher and to practice and problem solve with others. The aim is that by the end of the course you will have a strong practical grounding in applying data science approaches to research problems that will enhance the biology that you are doing.  \n\n## Online Materials\n\nThe rest of this handbook outlines the online materials provided to you for this course, broken down by the separate topics we will cover. The materials are a mixture of self-led tutorials and interactive challenges or problems to solve.    \n\n## Installation of software and tools\n\nIf you are using a TSL laptop specifically given to you for the MSc then all the software and tools you will need should already be installed on that machine. Each topic presents installation instructions for those not accessing the materials as part of the MSc or for installation on other or personal machines should they be needed. \n\n## Course Topics\n\nWe will cover the following topics in data science\n\n    1. Introduction to Genomics\n    2. Data Exploration and Visualisation\n    3. Understanding Statistics With Linear Models\n    4. Introduction to Non-Frequentist Statistics\n    5. Introduction to Machine Learning\n    6. Beginning Programming\n    7. Literate Computation\n\n## Course Assessments\n\nThe culmination of all this learning and practice will be a written essay and a data analysis project on which you will be assessed and receive a grade. These will be set during the course and deadlines will be given to you explicitly for each. You will not be formally assessed on other projects, quizzes and challenges occurring through the course.\n\n### Deadlines\n\nHere are the course deadlines for the 2021/2022 year.\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE, warning =FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ntibble::tibble(\n    `Assessment` = c('Formative 1 (Essay)', 'Formative 2 (Data)', 'Summative 1 (Essay)', 'Summative 2 (Essay)'),\n    `Deadline` = ymd(c(\"2021-12-1\", \"2021-12-15\", \"2022-1-12\", \"2022-1-22\")),\n    `Return Date` = ymd(c(\"2022-1-12\", \"2022-1-26\", \"2022-2-9\", \"2022-2-22\")),\n    `Blackboard ID` = c(\"BIO-7046Y FM1\",\"BIO-7046Y FM2\",\"BIO-7046Y SM1\",\"BIO-7046Y SM2\")\n    \n) %>% \n    gt() %>% \n        tab_header(\n            title = \"Important Assessment Dates\"\n        ) %>% \n        fmt_date(\n            columns = c(Deadline, `Return Date`)\n        ) \n    \n\n```\n\n## Schedule\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Message=FALSE}\ntibble::tibble(\n    `Date` = c(\"2021-10-18 09:30\", \"2021-10-29 13:00\", \"2021-11-12 13:00\", \"2021-11-19 13:00\", \"2021-11-26 13:00\", \"2021-12-10 13:00\", \"2022-1-7 13:00\", \"2022-1-21 13:00\" ),\n    `Session` = c(\"Course Intro and Intro to Genomics\", \"Intro to Genomics and Databases\", \"Data Exploration and Visualisation\", \"Understanding Statistics\", \"Literate Computation\", \"Beginning Programming\", \"Non-Frequentist Stats\", \"Machine Learning\"),\n    `Location` = c(rep(\"Room??\", 8))\n)     %>% \n\ngt() %>% \n        tab_header(\n            title = \"Data Science Schedule 2021/2022\"\n        ) %>% \n        fmt_datetime(\n            columns = c(Date)\n        ) \n\n```\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":6.5,"fig-height":4.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
