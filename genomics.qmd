# Introduction to Command Line


Getting started with using a command line (or 'shell') is the fundamental step in bioinformatics. This interface is the 'real' interface to a computer and lets you work massively more efficiently and on very big scales. It is also the only way to use the large HPC cluster and the many bioinformatics programs on there. So you're going to need this skill.


## The materials

This topic comprises the following courses. You may recognise some of it, as the first part follows the excellent Data Carpentry Shell Genomics Curriculum [https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop)


  1. [Shell Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/)
  2. [Data Wrangling and Processing for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/)
  3. [Introduction to Installing HPC Software with Singularity](https://bioinformatics.tsl.ac.uk/hpc/singularity/workshop/2022/04/24/hpc-singularity-workshop.html)


## Delivery

As these topics are the first that people generally need to do we deliver them as instructor-led bootcamps. It is however _always_ useful to read the materials provided before the course

## Timetable

Much of this is done on-demand, so if a course session isn't listed in a timeframe that you're comfortable with then contact Clara JÃ©gousse or George Deeks for information. In many instances we'll be able to sort a session soon.
