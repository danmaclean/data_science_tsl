    "text": "Welcome to the TSL Bioinformatics Training Website.\nIn here you will find links to the written content for each of the separate topics covered as well as the descriptions of the courses and a guide to helping you work out what you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait - I just want to use the HPC.\n\n\n\nThat’s great! To get an account, email George Deeks and he’ll initiate that for you. There’s a short induction with George that is compulsory - it aims to help you work out where everything is and acts as a refresher. If you’re already capable at the command line it takes about 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh - I want to use the HPC but don’t have command line experience yet.\n\n\n\nThat’s great too, seek out Clara Jégousse and her Intro to Command Line course, this will give you the skills on working at the command line. Once you’ve got the basics you’ll be good to use the HPC.\n\n\n\n\nBioinformatics and Data Science comprise a set of practical research skills grounded in statistics and computer science. Learning a practical skill requires practice! So these courses are not lecture courses, they are a mixture of ‘flipped’ classroom courses and bootcamp style courses each with a very strong practical component. In this framework the onus is on the learner to lead their work and practice with the provided materials prior to contact and discussion time with the wider learning group and group mentors. Contact time will then be an opportunity to discuss the materials and any problems arising with the group and the teacher and to practice and problem solve with others. The aim is that you will have a strong practical grounding in using bioinformatics and data science approaches to research problems that will enhance the biology that you are doing.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this site outlines the online materials provided, broken down by the separate topics we cover. The materials contain a mixture of self-led tutorials and interactive challenges or problems to solve.\n\n\n\nMost of the topics outline the stuff you will need to install. Sometimes this is fiddly and sometimes it just doesn’t work (and often when it doesn’t work it isn’t because you did something wrong). If you don’t feel confident or are having problems see George Deeks and Chris Rickett for help\n\n\n\nThe following topics are covered in our training\n1. Introduction to Bioinformatics on the Command-Line and HPC\n2. Introduction to Online Databases\n3. Data Exploration and Visualisation\n4. Understanding Statistics With Linear Models\n5. Introduction to Non-Frequentist Statistics\n6. Introduction to Machine Learning\n7. Beginning Programming\n8. Literate Computation\nNone of them are compulsory, all are open to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCohorts\n\n\n\nWe provide our sessions to each TSL cohort separately - meaning that we generally host separate workshops for Students and Post Docs to reflect the different needs and interests of the different groups. If you’re not sure which cohort you should go to, ask us. It may be that we need to organise something specific for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Upcoming sessions\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Session\n      Date\n      Cohort\n      Type\n      Start Time\n      Location\n      Lead\n    \n  \n  \n    Data Exploration and Visualisation\nTuesday, July 5, 2022\nPD\nFlipped Class Workshop Session\n1330\nG72\nDan\n    Data Exploration and Visualisation\nFriday, July 8, 2022\nStu\nFlipped Class Workshop Session\n1330\nG72\nDan\n    Stats with Linear Models\nTuesday, August 16, 2022\nPD\nFlipped Class Workshop Session\n1330\nG72\nDan\n    Stats with Linear Models\nThursday, August 18, 2022\nStu\nFlipped Class Workshop Session\n1330\nG72\nDan\n    Other Topics\nTuesday, September 13, 2022\nPD\nFlipped Class Workshop Session\n1330\nG72\nDan\n    Other Topics\nThursday, September 15, 2022\nStu\nFlipped Class Workshop Session\n1330\nG72\nDan"

    "text": "The topics are delivered in one of three ways:\n\nBootcamp\nFlipped classroom\nOnline tutorial\n\nEach type of class has a different emphasis and approach regardless of the topic under study.\n\n\nThe bootcamp style class is an instructor led practical session. You will be expected to follow an instructor who is teaching and live coding from the front of the class. This is not a lecture where you take notes - its a computer class where you work concurrently with the instructor as they exemplify the skills you will need to learn to use. Much more like a cookery class than a university lecture, the session proceeds with the instructor demonstrating how to do a specific computer-based skill and you try it out immediately. It is very, very useful to take the opportunity to read the materials for bootcamps before the session. Learning from this style requires you to be alert and engaged with the material in the session, not least you should put effort into joining in and being part of the group. Be prepared to make mistakes and be at peace with not knowing yet and being on a journey of learning. Sitting back and hoping to catch up with it later in your own time will put you behind and waste the opportunity of the session.\n\n\n\nThe ‘flipped’ classroom style here is one in which the reading is done by the student before the session. This gives time for reflection and understanding of the concepts such that they can be applied to solve the problem sets that come up in the session. The instructor will not conduct a comprehensive overview of the materials during the session, instead they will concentrate on issues arising in the application of the concepts. If you have not done the reading before the session then you will be behind from the start of the session and you will miss out on the opportunity. Learning from this style is requires you to lead and take responsibility for the learning before class and to work to apply the theoretical knowledge in the practical session.\n\n\n\nThe most traditional style of session will be the online tutorial in which you will work through an online guide with embedded quizzes and questions on a particular topic. The materials will be provided in the session. Learning from this style of session requires you to be thinking through the questions and reasoning to work out the answers with the materials provided."

Although you are at least a Post-Grad there are still a lot of things and skills to learn and you will spend a lot of time confused. This is fine. And expected, and a necessary part of learning - if it was easy you wouldn’t be learning anything. Over and over again you’ll fall into the metaphorical ‘Learning Pit’ (Nottingham 2015) and through working at a problem sincerely with a view to understanding you’ll reach real success - a good understanding of the topics you are learning about.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork from James Nottingham - https://www.challenginglearning.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dark side\nLots of people want to use data science and statistics so lots of other people publish blog posts and tutorials on those topics on the internet. A quick google will lead you to how-to’s in briefer and shallower form than this course. Be wary of taking these as an answer, although they aren’t wrong per se, the useful and particular ways of thinking about data science that this course is aimed at helping you understand are not so often developed in the quick online tutorials. They can help you with an immediate coding problem, it can take a very long time to develop broad and flexible understanding of data science through just looking stuff up on the internet and applying them until they seem to work. This dark side is quick, easy and seductive but won’t bring you a good understanding. Take your time and work through the details and you’ll emerge with a much more adaptable and applicable set of skills."

Otherwise the Data Exploration and Visualisation will be of great help in your day-to-day data analysis (especially that which comes out of command line programs). The fundamental topic is the Understanding Statistics with Linear Models which helps to show the linking thread between the statistical tools used in many data science and bioinformatics applications. The wider courses like Non-Frequentist Statistics and Machine Learning are excellent extensions that really power up the tool boxes and will let you get clearly at tricky data and big data sets.\nThey’re all available all the time and the team are happy to discuss any aspect of them whenever, so feel free to try any and all."
