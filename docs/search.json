    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the handbook for the data science component of the TSL M.Sc in Global Plant Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by AllisonHorst\n\n\n\n\nIn here you will find links to the written content for each of the separate topics covered as well as the descriptions of the course assessments and projects.\n\n\nData Science is a set of practical research skills grounded in statistics and computer science. Learning a practical skill requires practice! So this course is not a lecture course, it is a ‘flipped’ classroom course with a very strong practical component. In a flipped classroom the onus is on the student to lead their work and practice with the provided materials prior to contact and discussion time with the wider learning group and group mentors. To get the most out of this course you must read the relevant online material before you come to the contact sessions. Contact time will then be an opportunity to discuss the materials and any problems arising with the group and the teacher and to practice and problem solve with others. The aim is that by the end of the course you will have a strong practical grounding in applying data science approaches to research problems that will enhance the biology that you are doing.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this handbook outlines the online materials provided to you for this course, broken down by the separate topics we will cover. The materials are a mixture of self-led tutorials and interactive challenges or problems to solve.\n\n\n\nIf you are using a TSL laptop specifically given to you for the MSc then all the software and tools you will need should already be installed on that machine. Each topic presents installation instructions for those not accessing the materials as part of the MSc or for installation on other or personal machines should they be needed.\n\n\n\nWe will cover the following topics in data science\n1. Introduction to Genomics\n2. Data Exploration and Visualisation\n3. Understanding Statistics With Linear Models\n4. Introduction to Non-Frequentist Statistics\n5. Introduction to Machine Learning\n6. Beginning Programming\n7. Literate Computation\nSections 1,2,3 and 7 are considered the core parts and each has guided study parts that we will use. Sections 4,5 and 6 are considered extension parts. The core will be covered first and the extension parts can be covered as we decide in the class dependent on preference and interest.\n\n\n\nThe culmination of all this learning and practice will be a written essay and a data analysis project on which you will be assessed and receive a grade. These will be set during the course and deadlines will be given to you explicitly for each. You will not be formally assessed on other projects, quizzes and challenges occurring through the course.\n\n\nHere are the course deadlines for the 2021/2022 year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Important Assessment Dates\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Assessment\n      Deadline\n      Return Date\n      Blackboard ID\n    \n  \n  \n    Formative 1 (Essay)\nWednesday, December 1, 2021\nWednesday, January 12, 2022\nBIO-7046Y FM1\n    Formative 2 (Data)\nWednesday, December 15, 2021\nWednesday, January 26, 2022\nBIO-7046Y FM2\n    Summative 1 (Essay)\nWednesday, January 12, 2022\nWednesday, February 9, 2022\nBIO-7046Y SM1\n    Summative 2 (Essay)\nSaturday, January 22, 2022\nTuesday, February 22, 2022\nBIO-7046Y SM2\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Data Science Schedule 2021/2022\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Date\n      Session\n      Location\n    \n  \n  \n    Monday, October 18, 2021 09:30\nCourse Intro and Intro to Genomics\nRoom??\n    Friday, October 29, 2021 13:00\nIntro to Genomics and Databases\nRoom??\n    Friday, November 12, 2021 13:00\nData Exploration and Visualisation\nRoom??\n    Friday, November 19, 2021 13:00\nUnderstanding Statistics\nRoom??\n    Friday, November 26, 2021 13:00\nLiterate Computation\nRoom??\n    Friday, December 10, 2021 13:00\nBeginning Programming\nRoom??\n    Friday, January 7, 2022 13:00\nNon-Frequentist Stats\nRoom??\n    Friday, January 21, 2022 13:00\nMachine Learning\nRoom??"

    "section": "",
    "text": "At first thought, you may imagine that data science is not going to be of much interest to you, your desire and interest is in biology, not computers and mathematics. That may be true but data science is actually going to be one of the main technical themes throughout your entire scientific career and it will help you truly master your science and to become an informed and healthily sceptical interpreter of scientific results. Adding data science as your super power will be of benefit in lots of ways. Learning data science now isn’t a tax on your time so that you can get through this M.Sc, it’s a valuable investment in your skill set that will help to give you an advantage that will pay definite dividends later. Getting on with data science is like getting on with Jedi training for biologists"

    "text": "All experimental science is data science sooner or later\n“Data Science” is a new-ish term that describes an interdisciplinary approach to the practical application of statistics and computer science concepts and tools. The term data scientist is most often applied to people who analyse large amounts of high throughput data full time and have a research or industrial interest in that but the techniques of data science are useful to all researchers, data science is useful to biologists. There is no such thing as a purely lab- or field-based biologist, once our data are collected we must use it in a computer to perform analyses, draw conclusions and draw figures. All modern scientists are at some point a data scientist, irrespective of field and training. Knowledge of data science techniques will therefore underpin everything you do as a scientist at the most fundamental level, from experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of results. A scientist that lacks data science skills will find it very difficult to progress beyond the most basic levels of expertise in experimental analysis."

They can help you share and report on your research and data in a way that is transparent and clear to the reader. They can also help you make the data and analysis you have generated shareable and findable by others."

    "text": "The topics in this course will be delivered in one of three ways:\n\nBootcamp\nFlipped classroom\nOnline tutorial\n\nEach type of class has a different emphasis and approach regardless of the topic under study.\n\n\nThe bootcamp style class is an instructor led practical session. You will be expected to follow an instructor who is teaching and live coding from the front of the class. This is not a lecture where you take notes - its a computer class where you work concurrently with the instructor as they exemplify the skills you will need to learn to use. Much more like a cookery class than a university lecture, the session proceeds with the instructor demonstrating how to do a specific computer-based skill and you try it out immediately. It is very, very useful to take the opportunity to read the materials for bootcamps before the session. Learning from this style requires you to be alert and engaged with the material in the session, not least you should put effort into joining in and being part of the group. Be prepared to make mistakes and be at peace with not knowing yet and being on a journey of learning. Sitting back and hoping to catch up with it later in your own time will put you behind and waste the opportunity of the session.\n\n\n\nThe ‘flipped’ classroom style here is one in which the reading is done by the student before the session. This gives time for reflection and understanding of the concepts such that they can be applied to solve the problem sets that come up in the session. The instructor will not conduct a comprehensive overview of the materials during the session, instead they will concentrate on issues arising in the application of the concepts. If you have not done the reading before the session then you will be behind from the start of the session and you will miss out on the opportunity. Learning from this style is requires you to lead and take responsibility for the learning before class and to work to apply the theoretical knowledge in the practical session.\n\n\n\nThe most traditional style of session will be the online tutorial in which you will work through an online guide with embedded quizzes and questions on a particular topic. The materials will be provided in the session. Learning from this style of session requires you to be thinking through the questions and reasoning to work out the answers with the materials provided."

Although you are at least a Post-Grad there are still a lot of things and skills to learn and you will spend a lot of time confused. This is fine. And expected, and a necessary part of learning - if it was easy you wouldn’t be learning anything. Over and over again you’ll fall into the metaphorical ‘Learning Pit’ (Nottingham 2015) and through working at a problem sincerely with a view to understanding you’ll reach real success - a good understanding of the topics you are learning about.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork from James Nottingham - https://www.challenginglearning.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dark side\nLots of people want to use data science and statistics so lots of other people publish blog posts and tutorials on those topics on the internet. A quick google will lead you to how-to’s in briefer and shallower form than this course. Be wary of taking these as an answer, although they aren’t wrong per se, the useful and particular ways of thinking about data science that this course is aimed at helping you understand are not so often developed in the quick online tutorials. They can help you with an immediate coding problem, it can take a very long time to develop broad and flexible understanding of data science through just looking stuff up on the internet and applying them until they seem to work. This dark side is quick, easy and seductive but won’t bring you a good understanding. Take your time and work through the details and you’ll emerge with a much more adaptable and applicable set of skills."

That means they are led by you and you have the responsibility for doing the reading prior to coming to the session. You will absolutely need to devote time and work through the materials on your own and bring any questions and queries that you have to the scheduled session for the topics."
